#### 1. Folder Structure

- `/config`: Contains the source code for dependency injection.
- `/data`: Contains the source code for the business logic.
- `/domain`: Contains the source code for the business data/models.
- `/generated`: Contains the source code for the files automatically generated by build_runner.
- `/routing`: Contains the source code for the UI routing logic.
- `/ui`: Contains the source code for the UI.

#### 2. Libraries and Frameworks

- Flutter and Dart for the frontend and business logic.
- ObjectBox for local data storage.
- Supabase for remote data access.
- Sentry for error tracking and monitoring.

#### 3. Coding Patterns

- Use the `Provider` package for dependency injection and state management.
- Use the `Repository` pattern for data access.
- Use the `Command` and `Result` pattern for actions that can be executed asynchronously.

#### 4. Coding Standards

- Follow the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern.
- Use const constructors whenever possible.
- Comments should be clear and concise, explaining the why behind the code rather than the what.
- Comments should be contained within the code blocks.
- Constructor parameters must be placed above the constructor body.
- Internal variables should be prefixed with an underscore and must be placed below the constructor body.
