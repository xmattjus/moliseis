### Project Overview

This project is a multi-platform application that allows users to explore the Molise region in Italy. It is built using Flutter, uses ObjectBox for local data storage, and integrates with the Supabase backend for remote data access.

---

#### 1. Folder Structure

- `/config`: Contains the source code for dependency injection.
- `/data`: Contains the source code for the business logic.
- `/domain`: Contains the source code for the business data/models.
- `/generated`: Contains the source code for the files automatically generated by build_runner.
- `/routing`: Contains the source code for the UI routing logic.
- `/ui`: Contains the source code for the UI.

#### 2. Libraries and Frameworks

- Flutter and Dart for the frontend and business logic.
- ObjectBox for local data storage.
- Supabase for remote data access.
- Sentry for error tracking and monitoring.

#### 3. Coding Patterns

- Use the `Provider` package for dependency injection and state management.
- Use the `Repository` pattern for data access.
- Use the `Command` and `Result` pattern for actions that can be executed asynchronously.

#### 4. Coding Standards

- Follow the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern.
- Use const constructors whenever possible.
- Comments should be clear and concise, explaining the why behind the code rather than the what.
- Comments should be contained within the code blocks.
- Constructor parameters must be placed above the constructor body.
- Internal variables should be prefixed with an underscore and must be placed below the constructor body.
- Documentation comments should follow the Effective Dart guidelines and be used for all public classes and methods.
- Documentation comments must use triple slashes (///) and each line should contain atmost 80 characters. Each phrase should end with a period.
- Documentation comments for classes should include a brief description of the class's purpose and functionality. Focus on the "why" rather than the "what".

#### 5. Commit Message Format
- Generated commit messages should follow the Conventional Commits specification:
  - Each commit message must consist of a header, and optionally a body and footer:
  ```
  <header>
  <BLANK LINE>
  <body>
  <BLANK LINE>
  <footer>
  ```
  - The header is mandatory and must contain a type, an optional scope, and a subject: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`
    - `<type>`: A noun indicating the type of change. Common types include:
      - `build`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries.
      - `ci`: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts.
      - `docs`: Changes to documentation.
      - `feat`: A new feature.
      - `fix`: A bug fix.
      - `perf`: A code change that improves performance.
      - `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature.
      - `test`: Adding or updating tests.
    - `<scope>`: A noun indicating the section of the codebase affected (optional).
    - `<subject>`: A short description of the change in imperative mood.
  - The body is optional and should provide a more detailed explanation of the change, wrapped at 72 characters.
  - The footer is optional and should include any relevant issue references or breaking changes.
  - Examples:
    - `feat(auth): add login functionality`
    - `fix(ui): resolve button alignment issue`
    - `docs(readme): update installation instructions`
